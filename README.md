Kaggle Digit Recognizer challenge

I have entered the Digit Recognizer Challenge because I wanted to work on image recognition and enter a competition with many contestants. My goal was to place in the 1sth quarter on the leaderboard!

First, I have created a validation set from the train set to be able to assess model performance without needing to submit predictions on Kaggle for every model. 
Then, I picked the best models and trained them on the full training set.

I have reached accuracy 0.9954 on the full training set (stopped at epoch 69) which gave me an accuracy of 0.9938 in the challenge, that is place 575 out of 2788. Made it to the 21st percentile!
